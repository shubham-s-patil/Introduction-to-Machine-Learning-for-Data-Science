# Data Science 2: Introduction to Machine Learning for Data Science 

## Content
The primary source of content will be relatively bare Azure Notebooks where the instructor will guide you through discovering the different features of Python, NumPy, Pandas, and general data cleaning and manipulation. There is also a folder called "Reference Material" which has all of the same content in the primary notebooks, plus written explanations and additional features not covered in this project. 


## Tips and Tricks
Azure Notebooks is still in Preview. This means that there are some times when it will fail. Here are some tips for avoiding losing your work:
- Ensure their work is being saved. In the Jupyter Notebook there is always one of two messages to the right of the title of the notebook: `(autosaved)` or `(unsaved changes)`. Make sure you're noticing that your work is being saved. You should consider checking every 10 minutes or so. 
- Sometimes Notebooks get into a state where the Kernel cannot be started. Sometimes re-starting the kernel will work. But often you will have to somepletely sign out of Azure Notebooks and then sign back in.
